## Introduction


The shiny app under development allows a user to enter some basic information about a Breast Cancer Patients who has undergone a surgery, and obtain a prediction that patient will survive 5 years or longer  or die Within 5 years after her Surgery.  The app relies on a simple Random Forest algorithm and a data set "Haberman's Survival Dataset" from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.

## Description of Haberman's Survival Dataset 

Dataset that was used for buliding the model :

* The Random Forest Predictive model was bulid up on the basis of Haberman's Survival Data Set.
* The dataset contains cases from a study that was conducted between 1958 and 1970 at the University of Chicago's Billings Hospital.
* It contains recodrs of the survival of patients who had undergone surgery for breast cancer.

## Survival Prediction of Breast Cancer Patient Who has Undergone a Surgery!!!

1. Enter the age of patient at time Of Operation
2. Enter patient's year of Operation
3. Enter number of positive axillary nodes detected in the test
4. Get the survival prediction result based on Random Forest Algorithm within few seconds
